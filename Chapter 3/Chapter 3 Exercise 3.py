Chapter 3 Exercise 3: your own list
Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list

to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

list = ["I would like to own a Mercedes G-class."]
print(*list)
list= ["I would like to own a Range Rover Defender."]
print(*list)
list = ["I would like to own a Honda Odyssey."]
print(*list)

"""
I wrote every string manually like i did on my chapter 1 but this time i use a * symbol to remove the list bracket so that i can only print the message.
