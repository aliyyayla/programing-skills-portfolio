If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d

like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, invitingthem to dinner.

guestlist = ["Anne Hathaway", "TXT Soobin", "Lily James"]
     
print("Dear", guestlist[0], "I would like to invite you to dinner." )
print("Dear", guestlist[1], "I would like to invite you to dinner.")
print("Dear", guestlist[2], "I would like to invite you to dinner.")

So I did print everything manually and using the index where i can identify which name i should print. Then after using the index to i identify the name, i can print the name with a message saying that i would like to invite that person for dinner.
