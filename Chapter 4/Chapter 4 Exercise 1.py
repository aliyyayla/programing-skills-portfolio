Chapter 4- Exercise 1: Alien Colors #1
Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

alien_color = "Green" 
if alien_color == "Green":
    print("You just earned 5 points.") 
    
alien_color = "Red"
if alien_color == "Green":
    print("You just earned 5 points.")

"""
using the if statement, if the alien is green the print would say as "you just earned 5 points" and if u type another color the outcome will not print
