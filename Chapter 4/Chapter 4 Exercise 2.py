Chapter 4 Exercise 2: Alien Colors #1
Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an if-else chain.

•If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

•If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

•Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
"""

alien_color = "Green"

if alien_color== "Green":
    print("Hey player ! You just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.")
else:
    print("Hey player ! You just earned 10 points.")

"""
in this chapter, i used an if-else statement where the if condition is "if the alien color is Green" thus it will print the message, else, it will not print "You just earned 5 points" but will print "you just earned 10 points ".
