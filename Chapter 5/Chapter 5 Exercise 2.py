Chapter 5 Exercise 2: Glossary
A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store
their meanings as values.

Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print
the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between
each word-meaning pair in your output.

num_1 = {"if-else statement": 
         "if the condition is true, else if the body is false."}
print(num_1)

print("\n")# for spacing

num_2 = {"arithmetic operators": "used with numeric values for mathematical operations."}
print(num_2)

print("\n")

num_3 = {"Variable": "reusable containter for storing a value;can store data of different types."}
print(num_3)

print("\n")

num_4 = {"List": "a collection of which is ordered and changable. Duplicating is OK."}
print(num_4)

print("\n")

num_5 = {"Tuple": "collection of which is ordered but unchangable. Duplicating is also OK."}
print(num_5)

same thing with what i did here in chapter 5, i printed the dictionary manually so i can print the key-value and using spaces (\n) to print the message neatly.
