Chapter 2 Exercise 2: Variables
Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author.

Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:

Albert Einstein once said, â€œA person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
"""

quote = "If you can dream it, you can do it. \n- Walt Disney"
print(quote) 

"""
same as the previous chapter, i made a variable called "quote" and use the \n for a space so that when you print it, it will look like a quote.
